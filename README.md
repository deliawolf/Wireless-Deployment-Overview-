# Wireless-Deployment-Overview-

There are several types of WLAN deployments:

## Autonomous:

Used for hotspots or smaller enterprises

Individual access point (AP) management

Simple to deploy and cost-effective

## Centralized:

Campus environments where traffic is centralized

APs connect to switches, which connect to centralized WLCs

## FlexConnect:

Designed for enterprises that have branch or remote offices

Locations with a relatively small number of APs where deployment of a WLC is not justified or desired

Wireless LAN (WLAN) data traffic is either tunneled back to a central WLC (central switching), or the data traffic is broken out locally at the wired interface (local switching) of the AP

## Cisco Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) Wireless:

Integration of wireless access in the SD-Access architecture

Moves the enterprise network from the current VLAN-centric architecture to a user group-based enterprise architecture, with flexible Layer 2 extensions within and across sites

Automated network provisioning through the Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center application

## Cloud-managed:

Cloud-based virtual controllers provided through the Cisco Meraki or the Cisco 9800 Cloud Controller solutions

Centralized installation and management

Scales from small branches to large networks

Reduces operational costs

Reduces IT staff size
